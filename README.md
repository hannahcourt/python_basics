# Instructions for the Notebook

Throughout this notebook, I worked on various Python basics and applied them to solve problems using two datasets across three files:

- **`seeds_dataset.csv`**
- **`domains.csv`**
- **`admins.csv`**

## Approach

### **Cell Types and What I Did**

1. **PROVIDED CODE**: 
   - I ensured to run all pre-written code cells that set up the environment. These cells were not modified as instructed.

2. **SOLUTION CELLS**:
   - I implemented my solutions here by applying Python basics such as loops, conditionals, and data handling with libraries like `pandas`.

3. **TESTING CELL**:
   - These cells allowed me to validate my solutions. I did not change these cells but ran them to check correctness.

4. **ANSWER CELLS**:
   - I wrote textual answers and explanations for the required questions here, applying my understanding of the topics covered in class.

### **Important Considerations**

- I did not alter the **PROVIDED CODE** or **TESTING CELL**, adhering to the guidelines to avoid any issues with grading.
- The provided code was executable and error-free. While the templates in **SOLUTION CELLS** did not initially produce correct solutions, I worked on these to ensure my solutions were functional.
- If I encountered issues in my code, I commented out incomplete or erroneous parts and left clear notes about my approach.

### Python Basics Applied

- Reading and analyzing CSV files with `pandas`.
- Writing functions to process and manipulate data.
- Using control structures such as loops (`for`, `while`) and conditionals (`if`, `else`).
- Ensuring error-free execution by debugging syntax and runtime issues.

## Dataset Usage

The notebook involved the following datasets:

- **`seeds_dataset.csv`**: Used for tasks related to seed classification.
- **`domains.csv`**: Analyzed domain data for specific tasks.
- **`admins.csv`**: Used to process and evaluate administrative records.

I ensured to carefully load and interact with these datasets using Python libraries like `pandas`.

## Submission Checklist

- I ran all necessary cells before submission to ensure the solutions worked as intended.
- Incomplete or erroneous code was commented out to prevent breaking the notebook.
- I provided thorough explanations and textual answers in all **ANSWER CELLS** to clarify my solutions.

Happy coding!
